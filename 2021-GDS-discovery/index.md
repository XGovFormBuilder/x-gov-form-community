# Discovery to learn about collecting information from users

The Government Digital Service (GDS) is running a discovery to learn more about collecting information from users.

## Why GDS is running a discovery

In May 2017, a team started [trying to solve problems with government services processing information that is submitted offline](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/15/collecting-information/). Namely, paper forms. üìÑ

In October 2017, they were ready to launch a Private Beta to test if GOV.UK Submit could scale. Then, that work was paused. ‚è∏

In the three years from then until August 2020, government departments invested in solving these problems themselves, so GDS wanted to facilitate conversations about the emerging duplication of effort, and [launched this cross-government form building community](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/08/12/join-the-cross-government-form-building-community/). üöÄ

GDS is currently looking at the extent to which those problems remain unsolved. A lot has happened in three and a half years. This discovery will help GDS decide whether there is value in further investment. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We won't be working on this beyond March 2021 unless we find unmet user needs and are successful in getting funding.

## Who is on the team

The team only has one full time member:

- [Harry Vos](https://twitter.com/vosageroll), Senior Product Manager

Harry is supported part-time by:

- [Nick Breeze](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-breeze-87522530/), Lead User Researcher
- [Venus Bailey](https://twitter.com/VenusShum), Lead Enterprise Architect
- Ben Donovan, Economist

GDS hopes to make the team more multi-disciplinary soon, to help make more informed decisions. In addition, the team will be doing its best to adopt a more multi-disciplinary view by learning from members of this cross-government form community, as well as different communities of practice.

## Updates from the team

The team is publishing short updates here on what they learn. They hope working in the open will help them get feedback from the community.
