# Sprint 4: why most government forms are still PDFs

Written by [Harry Vos](https://twitter.com/vosageroll)

This is a nice short update. My talk from #ServicesWeek covers most of what we've been up to over the past sprint.

## Why most government forms are still PDFs, often hard to access and use. What could we do about it?

## What we did in the past two weeks

- gave a talk for #ServicesWeek on [why most government forms are still PDFs, often hard to access and use. What could we do about it?](https://youtu.be/A6NAPQVwNOc?t=5799)
- iterated our definition of what good low volume services look like, working with the GDS Service Standard, Service Assessments and Accessibility teams
- spoke to HM Revenue & Customs about some of the limitations of using existing form builders with multi-disciplinary teams, particularly for low volume forms
- observed a multi-disciplinary team use the [x-gov digital form builder](https://digital-form-builder-designer.herokuapp.com/) to make it easier to import a vehicle from the UK to Portugal
- hopefully found a frontend developer to help us evaluate the accessibility of existing products
- along with other community leads, started planning the next x-gov forms community workshop which is happening on Friday 30 April 2021
