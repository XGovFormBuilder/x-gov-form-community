# Alpha Prototypes
## Sprint 2
### Hypothetical product page
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/fJRb7y9NQ3LyJPvJgpRac8/Product-Pages?node-id=5%3A863&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=5%3A7&starting-point-node-id=5%3A863)


This prototype was presented to senior technology decision makers in different departments to test whether they would be willing to pay for a form builder and explore what functionality they would expect at different price points.

The prototype is a mocked-up product page for a hypothetical form building product.

Findings:
- A form builder could be cost-effective, if it is perceived to be good value for money.
- Senior technology decision-makers thought the following features represented value for money:
  - Strong back end processes (incl. Data processing, storage and security)
  - API integration
  - Good support systems

## Adding prototypes to this list
Prototypes should be added to this list when they are first shown to users.

They should be in chronological order, from oldest to newest, and grouped by sprint.

When adding a prototype to the list, try to include:
- a link to the prototype 
  - if this link is not publicly available, note this
- a rough description of the assumption the prototype is testing
- a rough description of the prototype itself
- the result of the experiment (if known)

If an updated/revised version of the prototype is created, add it to the list under the original prototype 
- you don't need to do this if the prototype is in Github/Google Drive/Figma or another format with its own native versioning system, but consider adding notes for any major updates
