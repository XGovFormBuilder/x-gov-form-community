## Form Builder Components

### About This Page

This page aims to capture some common technical components and best practices for form building tools.
It is structured around the needs of the teams creating and/or maintaining forms.
It includes links to the MOJ Forms and Home Office/ FCDO xGov Form builder repositories as example implementations for some of these concepts. 

This page should be reviewed and iterated on an ongoing basis with inputs from the cross-government form building community.
