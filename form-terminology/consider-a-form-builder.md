### Things to consider when developing or buying a form builder

If you are considering developing or buying a form building your should aim to make sure it:

- meets the needs of user (for example, content designers or developers)
- complies with any design requirement (for example, GOV.UK Design System, multi-language support)
- uses an open standard for form definition and ownership
- can handle your form logic needs (for example, branching, looping, skipping, one to many relations)
- integrates with your backend systems easily
- stores data in a secured way
- satisfies yours data access and privacy requirements
- has at least testing and production environments
- avoids locking your in to one vendor
- is evaluated so you know the total cost of ownership (for example, ongoing maintenance, specialist consultancy, any development costs)
