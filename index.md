## Cross government forms community

The community was formed by people from a few UK government departments in March 2020 working on forms.

The cross-government form building community was initially created to:

promote awareness and understanding of form builders in the public sector
encourage organisations to share and re-use tools, information and experiences
provide support for smaller organisations to get started with forms


To contribute, please raise an issue on github repository:
https://github.com/XGovFormBuilder/x-gov-form-community


If you're interested in joining the community and find out more about the community, please contact x-gov-forms@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk or visit the #form-builders channel in the cross-government Slack.
