## Cross Government Form Building Community

The community was formed by a few UK government departments in March 2020 working on forms.

The vision statement of the community is "Empower people across government to create accessible forms that work for users".

The community exists to:
- promote awareness and understanding of form builders and form building in the public sector
- encourage organisations to share and re-use tools, source codes, information and experiences
- provide a place to share knowledge and best practice

To contribute, please raise an issue or a pull request on the Github repository:
https://github.com/XGovFormBuilder/x-gov-form-community


If you're interested in joining the community and find out more about the community, please email x-gov-forms@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk or visit the #form-builders channel in the Cross-government Slack.
