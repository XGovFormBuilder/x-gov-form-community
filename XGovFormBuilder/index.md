## Community roundups and updates for XGovFormBuilder

Updates from the community at [https://github.com/XGovFormBuilder/digital-form-builder](https://github.com/XGovFormBuilder/digital-form-builder).

`digital-form-builder` or "XGovFormBuilder" is an open source project, started by our friends at DEFRA. 
Since then, Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO, FCO at the time) made significant productionalisation changes and integrations to make this a service builder fit for Government. 
We were kindly joined by HO where the "x-gov" community started to kick off.

You're welcome to try XGovFormBuilder on our [demo instance](https://digital-form-builder-designer.herokuapp.com/app),
and join our dedicated [slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/xgov-digital-form-bld/shared_invite/zt-xn5ltztf-3_oBzZaziV4sCpDDOGuP6Q) if you have any questions or need support.
