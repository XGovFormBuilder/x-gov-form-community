I (Jen, [@jenbutongit](https://github.com/jenbutongit)) thought Iâ€™d do a regular update for our community and share new fixes/features and celebrate our contributors.

### ðŸŽ‰ Thanks to David Biddle (GDS) for submitting a few issues and PRs!
- Weâ€™ve resolved an issue with AWS credential loading, weâ€™re allowing the AWS SDK handle loading the environment variables.
  Weâ€™ll have some space now to allow for awsâ€™ other methods of credential loading (like from file)
  [Pull request #683](https://github.com/XGovFormBuilder/digital-form-builder/pull/683)
- The issue with the designer crashing when you try to edit the feedbackForm url has been resolved by David
  [Pull request #693](https://github.com/XGovFormBuilder/digital-form-builder/pull/693)
- as well as some optional fields reporting a field as required https://github.com/XGovFormBuilder/digital-form-builder/pull/692


### ðŸŽ‰ Thanks also to Canterbury CC
who mistakenly opened a PR against our repo (ðŸ˜‰) instead of theirs.. Iâ€™ve had a nosey 'round and we could expect
- Freshdesk output integration
- Dynamo persistence integration
- Dynamic values (readonly values that are displayed to the user, based on previous inputs, similar to conditions)

### ðŸŽ‰ Last but not least, Fred Marecesche (DIT)
- for opening a draft PR for authentication (another frequently requested feature).
  - The PR has started off with an oAuth strategy using [@hapi/bell](https://hapi.dev/module/bell) (similar to passport.js for express), so other orgs are free to drop in their own strategies.

Weâ€™ve (Caution Your Blast) also managed to do some spiking around pre-filling a form last week as part of our hackathon.
Although Iâ€™m not sure how much wizard of oz-ing went on in the other teams, it seems entirely feasible to pull data from another source,
and fill a xgovformbuilder form, which is a feature thatâ€™s been mentioned/requested a few times.

Youâ€™re always welcome to open issues and PRs, or have a discussion with me on here if youâ€™re not sure whether your feature
should be added to the Open Source repo. Iâ€™m also always interested in hearing in what youâ€™re getting up to with forms anyway (even if you don't want to OS your solution ðŸ˜¢). 
It's been a lot of fun catching up with you all this week!

I think Iâ€™d like to collate all the repos into an "awesome" xgovformbuilder list so I can point any prospective orgs to
how youâ€™ve set it up and any neat features youâ€™ve added.
